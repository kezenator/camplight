The original archive pion-5.0.5.zip is provided
as reference to the originally downloaded version.

The full source code is commited as there have been a number
of changes to get it to work in the BrainBox system
(mainly single-threaded async shutdown) and also to remove
some warnings.

The doc folder is marked as svn:ignore so you can
continue to have this extracted from the archive for
reference.
