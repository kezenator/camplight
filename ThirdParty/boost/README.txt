Getting started in Windows
==========================

Extract the boost_1_59_0.7z file into this directory so there
is a boost_1_59_0\boost folder inside this folder that contains
all the .hpp files.

Getting started in Linux
========================

Run "make boost" to prepare the boost distribution.
Some patches are automatically applied to the extract files - see the "apply_linux_patches" file.
Once complete, run make again as normal.
